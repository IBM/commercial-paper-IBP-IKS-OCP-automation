# commercial-paper-IBP-IKS-OCP-automation
We have 2 existing repositories within ibm enterprise github that consist of ansible playbook collections for the automated deployment of a simple blockchain network: one for deployment on ibm kubernetes cluster, the other for deployment on openshift. We have a developerWorks tutorial publication on how to utilize these ansible collections and need to publish the repositories on the ibm external open source github.
